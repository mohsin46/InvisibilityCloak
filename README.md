# InvisibilityCloak

This was created as a part of miniproject for our audit course in Image Processing.
Made by Aparna Jadhav and Mohsin Shaikh under guidance of Prof. Vaibhav Vasani and Prof. Swapnil Pawar of K.J Somaiya College of Engineering, Vidyavihar.

Makes a cloak invisible by creating masks using opencv

With setColor you can dynamically add the range of hsv values of your cloak by simultaneously checking
it using trackbars.
Just adjust the trackbars such that only your cloak is visible.

After that add those values into the invisibiltyCloak upper and lower ranges.

The hsv range in this case has been set for red color.

When you run the program, stay out of sight for a few seconds and let the program store the background.
Now when you enter the camera's field of view, it will detect the cloak and make it invisible.
Enjoy!!!
